	 The refractive indices for Ag ( n , k values from 300 – 1000 nm ) , C60 ( n = 2.1 ) , and PVA ( n = 1.50 ) were also entered into the software to generate the minimum reflectivity plots .
	 This concept was proven by measuring the luminescence before and after infiltrating the lattice with a series of liquids of different refractive index , namely , methanol ( n = 1.33 ) , isopropanol ( n = 1.38 ) and tetrahydrofurane ( n = 1.41 ) .
	 The sensitivity of the nanodome array to changes in the bulk refractive index ( n ) was measured by exposing the sensor surface to air ( n = 1 ) , DI water ( n = 1.333 ) , acetone ( n = 1.359 ) and isopropyl alcohol ( n = 1.377 ) in sequence .
	 Thus , LDPE ( n = 1.51 ) renders composites with SPR at lower wavelengths compared to those based on PS ( n = 1.59 ) .
	 The blue shift in the SPR maximum for Cu / TiO2[aerogel / 24 ] relative to Cu / TiO2[aerogel / 6 ] ( Fig. 3a ) is indicative of an environment with a lower average dielectric ( Fig. S1 ) , which could be explained by an increased contribution from the lower refractive index of the more reduced oxide , Cu2O ( n = 2.4 ) , in agreement with the lessened Cu(II) satellite feature in the XPS ( Fig. 6 ) and the 60-fold increase in Cured in the relative Cu 2p3 / 2 atom ratio ( Table 1 ) .
	 The optical transmittance spectra obtained for the material , taken in three different ambient media of toluene ( refractive index n = 1.49 ) , methanol ( n = 1.33 ) and air ( n = 1.00 ) , are shown in Fig. 2 .
	 Three different solvents were used , chosen for their large difference in dielectric constants − air ( n = 1.0 ) , diH2O ( n = 1.333 ) and glycerol ( n = 1.472 ) ( Fig. 6 ) .
	 In this work , NOA164 ( n = 1.64 ) and NOA1375 ( n = 1.375 ) are the materials used for the core and the cladding of the waveguide , respectively .
	 The relative sensitivities of about 72.95 % , 74.55 % and 75.14 % with ultra-low confinement loss of 1.85 × 10 − 10 dB / m , 4.62 × 10 − 11 dB / m and 6.35 × 10 − 11 dB / m are gained at the 1.33 μm wavelength for water ( n = 1.33 ) , ethanol ( n = 1.354 ) and benzene ( n = 1.366 ) analytes respectively .
	 Three unique liquids such as water ( n = 1.330 ) , ethanol ( n = 1.354 ) , and benzene ( n = 1.366 ) are used to analysis the outputs .
	 The SBPCM was realized with three different immersion fluids , ethylene glycole ( n = 1.432 ) , microscope immersion oil ( n = 1.515 ) and methylene iodide ( n = 1.740 , brownish absorb- ing liquid ) .
	 Because of the large differences of refraction index from InGaN / GaN ( n ∼ 2.3 ) , sapphire ( n = 1.8 ) and air ( n = 1 ) , spectra were strongly modulated by the multiple reflectance from the InGaN / GaN between the sapphire substrate and air .
	 Aqueous analytes like water ( RI = 1.33 ) , ethanol ( RI = 1.354 ) and benzene ( RI = 1.366 ) were also explored for sensing purposes .
	 Various analytes with refractive index like Water ( n = 1.33 ) , Ethanol ( n = 1.354 ) and Benzyne ( n = 1.366 ) are filled in the supplementary air holes in the core region .
	 In order to evaluate the refractive index sensitivity of LSPR gold nanostructures structures produced , UV - vis absorption spectra and SE measurements were performed in media with different refractive indices : air ( n = 1 ) , water ( n = 1.3325 ) , ethanol ( n = 1.3616 ) , chloroform ( n = 1.4441 ) , and DMSO ( n = 1.4772 ) .
	 Finally the investigating effects of different structural parameters of the proposed P-PCF are optimized which shows the sensitivity of 60.57 % , 61.45 % and 61.82 % ; the confinement loss of 8.71 × 10− 08 dB / m , 1.41 × 10− 10 dB / m and 6.51 × 10− 10 dB / m for Water ( n = 1.33 ) , Ethanol ( n = 1.354 ) and Benzene ( n = 1.366 ) respectively at 1.33 μm wavelength .
	 According to several kinds analytes , in the core region all supplementary air holes are filled with three distinct thermo optic coefficients like Water ( n = 1.33 ) , Benzene ( n = 1.366 ) and Ethanol ( n = 1.354 ) where n is expressed as refractive index .
	 The relative sensitivity , confinement loss and the effective refractive coefficient of Water ( n = 1.33 ) , Ethanol ( n = 1.354 ) , Benzene ( n = 1.366 ) have been analyzed in this research .
	 The LSPR effects show obvious peaks of absorbance accompanying with a red shift in the wavelengths , where the peaks are located at 524 nm , 534.5 nm , 535.5 nm and 539 nm respectively for the environments in air ( R.I. = 1.00 ) , water ( R.I. = 1.33 ) , ethanol ( R.I. = 1.36 ) and methanol ( R.I. = 1.44 ) .
	 For the calculation , we assumed four layers , that are air ( refractive index , n = 1.0 ) , c-TiO2 ( n = 2.4 ) , FTO ( n = 2.0 ) , and glass ( n = 1.5 ) , and the incident light is normal to the multilayer and all the layers do not absorb light .
	 Then , silicon dioxide ( n = 1.469 ) and germanium - doped silicon dioxide ( n = 1.491 ) were deposited on the silicon wafer by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( PECVD ) at a thickness of 10 μm each .
	 Our constructed system uses deposited Bi film on the flat side of a 10 mm diameter infrared transparent ZnSe ( infrared refractive index n = 2.4 ) , Si ( n = 3.4 ) , or Ge ( n = 4.0 ) hemisphere as a working electrode .
	 Steady - state diffuse reflectance spectra were measured using five different coupling fluids : water ( n = 1.33 ) , 60 % sucrose solution ( n = 1.44 ) , vegetable oil ( n = 1.47 ) , ethyl salycilate ( n = 1.52 ) , and ethyl cinnamate ( n = 1.56 ) .
	 The red light emitted at the structure edge is evidence of a strong waveguide effect caused by the planar waveguide structure consisting of a GaN : Eu layer with high refractive index ( n ∼ 2.4 ) sandwiched between two low refractive index materials , sapphire ( n = 1.77 ) and air ( n = 1 ) .
	 This translates into the internal QE as high as ( 87 ± 7 ) % ph / e with φPL ≈ φPH ≈ 1 and the light output coupling factor ξ = 0.22 resulting from a difference between refractive indices of glass ( n = 1.5 ) , ITO ( n = 1.9 ) , and the organic compounds , norg = 1.7 , .
